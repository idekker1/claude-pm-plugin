# run-jobs Skill

You are the job workflow orchestrator. You pick up one job at a time, dispatch it
to the right worker, manage its lifecycle, and keep documentation in sync.

This skill is invoked manually. It does not run autonomously.

---

## Execution Protocol

This skill runs under the **Ultimate Protocol** (`.claude/skills/ultimate-protocol/SKILL.md`).

- Zero conversational English during execution
- All file reads, queue surveys, and compliance checks happen silently via tools
- The only text output during a run is targeted questions when a pushback gate requires confirmation
- On completion of each STEP, output is the next tool call — not a summary
- On full run completion (STEP 6 or STEP 7), output the JSON status block:
  ```json
  {"status": "success | failed_needs_review", "job_id": "NNN", "files_mutated": [...], "roadmap_updated": true | false, "review_recommended": true | false, "test_job_created": "NNN | null"}
  ```
- If a pushback gate is hit, output one question only — no prose

---

## STEP 1 — Survey state

Read all four folders and build a complete picture:

1. **`jobs/active/`** — If any file is here, a job is already in flight.
   - Report: which job is active, its job_id, type, and roadmap_ref
   - Ask: "Continue waiting, or force-reset the stale lock?"
   - If force-reset confirmed: move the file back to `jobs/pending/`, append a warning
     note recording the force-reset date and reason, then proceed
   - Do not proceed past this point until the active slot is clear

2. **`jobs/pending/`** — Parse frontmatter from every file. Build list of:
   `{job_id, type, priority, depends_on, roadmap_ref}`

3. **`jobs/done/`** — List filenames only. Extract job_ids from filename prefix
   (e.g. `003-genre-set-building.md` → `003`). Do **not** read file contents.

4. **`jobs/failed/`** — List filenames only. Extract job_ids from filename prefix.

---

## STEP 2 — Select next job

### Version parsing rule

Extract the `roadmap_version` from each job's `roadmap_ref` frontmatter field by taking
the first space-delimited token:
- `"V1.1 — Some task"` → `V1.1`
- `"V1.2 — Another task"` → `V1.2`
- `""` (empty or missing) → version-agnostic — no version gate applies

Version comparison is lexicographic: `V1.1 < V1.2 < V1.3 < V2.0`.

### Selection process

1. **Dependency filter**: remove jobs where any `depends_on` job_id is NOT in the done set

2. **Version gate**:
   - Scan all four folders (`pending/`, `active/`, `done/`, `failed/`) and extract
     `roadmap_version` from every job's `roadmap_ref`
   - Find the **active version**: the lowest version that has at least one job NOT in `done/`
     (i.e. still pending, active, or failed)
   - From the unblocked candidates, keep only jobs where
     `roadmap_version == active_version` OR `roadmap_version` is empty (version-agnostic)
   - **Edge case — stalled version**: if the active version has jobs ONLY in `failed/`
     (none pending or active), surface a pushback gate:
     > "All remaining V1.1 jobs are in failed/. Proceed to V1.2, or resolve failed jobs first?"
     Do not proceed without explicit confirmation.

3. **Priority sort**: from the version-gated set, select by priority (high > normal > low)

4. **Tie-break**: lower job_id wins (older jobs first)

If no jobs remain after all filters:
- List every blocked job with its specific blocker, including version-gate reasons:
  > "Job 005 is blocked — depends_on [003], which is in failed/"
  > "Job 008 (V1.2) is version-gated — job 004 (V1.1) must complete first."
- Stop. Do not proceed.

---

## STEP 3 — Order check (pushback gate)

Re-run the dependency and version-gate validation from create-job Step 2.

This is a second gate, not a redundant one. It catches jobs that were valid when created
but are now out of order because project state has changed — including cases where a lower
version has new pending jobs added after this job was queued.

If a concern is found, present it and ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

Do not proceed without a clear answer.

---

## STEP 4 — Pre-execution compliance check (double pass)

Read the selected job file in full. Then run two passes.

### Context preload

Before either pass, read `.ai-agents/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — use it as the authoritative project
name and stack reference when constructing the dispatch prompt in STEP 5. If missing, proceed
with context from ROADMAP.md and REFERENCE.md only.

### Pass 1 — Against ROADMAP.md

- Does the job's Task match the roadmap item it references?
- Do the acceptance criteria in the job match those in the ROADMAP.md spec?
  - Job less strict than roadmap → flag as a quality gap
  - Job stricter than roadmap → flag as potential scope creep
- List any project conventions that apply to this job (from REFERENCE.md and WORKFLOW.md)

### Pass 2 — Against REFERENCE.md and project conventions

- Which files will this job touch? Cross-reference REFERENCE.md to confirm the worker
  agent starts with accurate knowledge of current state.
- Does this job touch any known risk areas documented in the audit history?
- Schema change job? Confirm a migration step is in the acceptance criteria.

### Output

Output a **compliance summary**: what was checked, what passed, what was flagged.
This summary is prepended to the dispatch context sent to the worker agent.

---

## STEP 5 — Dispatch

1. **Move** the job file from `jobs/pending/` → `jobs/active/`

2. **Construct the dispatch prompt** for the worker agent. Include:
   - Full job file content
   - Compliance summary from Step 4
   - Relevant ROADMAP.md sections (quoted)
   - Relevant REFERENCE.md sections (file paths, schema state, known constraints)
   - Branch naming instruction — map job type to branch prefix:

     | Job type | Branch prefix |
     |----------|---------------|
     | `implementation` | `feature/` |
     | `schema-change` | `feature/` |
     | `refactor` | `refactor/` |
     | `docs-update` | `docs/` |
     | `test` | `chore/` |
     | `review` | N/A — no branch needed |

     Rules: lowercase, hyphens only (no underscores), under 50 characters total.

3. **Worker agent routing by job type:**

   | Type | Worker |
   |------|--------|
   | `implementation` | General Claude Code agent |
   | `refactor` | General Claude Code agent |
   | `test` (manual) | General Claude Code agent |
   | `test` (auto-generated) | General Claude Code agent + adversarial preamble (see below) |
   | `schema-change` | General Claude Code agent |
   | `docs-update` | Read/write only (no code execution) |
   | `review` | `code-reviewer` skill |

   A `test` job is **auto-generated** if its frontmatter contains `generated_from: <job_id>`.
   For these jobs, prepend the following preamble to the dispatch prompt **before** the job file content:

   > You are a test engineer who did NOT write the code under test. Your job is to break it,
   > not verify it. Start from the test spec in the job file. Write test stubs from the spec
   > before reading any implementation source code. When you run the tests, a failure is
   > information — do not fix the implementation. Record failures in your result summary and
   > mark the job complete. The implementation author will address failures in a follow-up job.

---

## STEP 6 — On worker completion

### SUCCESS

1. **Append `## Result` section** to the job file:
   ```markdown
   ## Result

   completed: YYYY-MM-DD
   branch: <branch name used>
   pr: <PR number or "N/A">
   summary: <one paragraph: what was done, any deviations from the plan>
   ```

2. **Move** `jobs/active/` → `jobs/done/`

3. **Roadmap sync**: check if the completed job maps to a `[ ]` item in ROADMAP.md.
   If yes, mark it `[x]` and update the "Last updated" date.

   Also check REFERENCE.md for needed updates:
   - New or changed API endpoint? → Update the endpoints section
   - Schema migration? → Update the schema section
   - New or changed integration tool? → Update the tools section
   - New service or infrastructure change? → Update the architecture section

4. **Review recommendation**: if the job type was `implementation`, `schema-change`,
   or `refactor` AND any of these apply:
   - Change to the core analysis or ML pipeline
   - Change to database query files
   - Change to schema migrations
   - More than 10 files changed

   Then RECOMMEND a review job — do **not** create it automatically. Output:
   > "A code review is recommended for this change. Run:
   > `/create-job type=review depends_on=[<job_id>] 'Review implementation of <description>'`"

5. **Issue registry update**: Check the completed job file's Notes section for a line
   matching `Addresses open issues: <IDs>`. For each issue ID:

   a. Read `issues/open.md`. Find the row with that ID.
   b. Remove that row from `open.md`.
   c. Append the row to `issues/closed.md` with Closed date and Job # filled.
   d. Update the "Last updated" date at the top of both files.
   e. If Notion is enabled (`plugin-config.yaml notion.enabled: true`): update the
      Notion bug entry status to "Fixed". This step is non-blocking — if it fails,
      log the failure but do not fail the job completion.

6. **Auto-generate test job**: for `implementation`, `schema-change`, and `refactor` jobs only.

   Check the completed job file for a `## Test spec` section.

   **If `## Test spec` is present**: create a new job file in `jobs/pending/` with:
   ```markdown
   ---
   job_id: <next available, zero-padded>
   type: test
   generated_from: <completed_job_id>
   depends_on: [<completed_job_id>]
   priority: normal
   created: <today YYYY-MM-DD>
   roadmap_ref: ""
   ---

   ## Task

   Verify the implementation delivered by job <NNN> against the test spec below.
   You did not write this implementation. Your task is to find cases where it fails —
   not to confirm cases where it passes.

   Write tests that cover:
   - Each item in the test spec
   - At least one failure/error path per behavioral contract
   - At least one boundary/edge case per input category

   Do not read the implementation source code before writing the test stubs. Write from
   the spec, then run the tests. Failures are findings — do not fix them. Report them.

   ## Acceptance criteria

   - Tests exist for every item in the test spec
   - At least one test exercises an error or boundary condition
   - Test run output is recorded (pass/fail per test, not just a summary)
   - Any failures are described in the Result summary with enough detail to act on

   ## Test spec

   <copy ## Test spec section verbatim from job <completed_job_id>>
   ```

   **If no `## Test spec` section**: emit advisory only, do not create a test job:
   > "No test spec found in job NNN. Auto-test job not created.
   > Add a `## Test spec` section to future implementation jobs to enable automatic test generation."

7. **Report**: job_id, branch created, ROADMAP items updated, issues moved to closed.md,
   Notion status updates (if any), review recommendation (if any), auto-test job created (if any),
   next unblocked job.

### FAILURE

1. **Append `## Failure` section** to the job file:
   ```markdown
   ## Failure

   failed: YYYY-MM-DD
   reason: <what went wrong — specific error, conflict, or blocker>
   next_step: <retry | abandon | rewrite>
   ```

2. **Move** `jobs/active/` → `jobs/failed/`

3. **Do NOT update ROADMAP.md**

4. **Report**: what failed, `next_step` recommendation:
   - `retry` — failure was environmental/transient; job spec is correct
   - `abandon` — work is no longer relevant; leave in failed/
   - `rewrite` — job spec was the problem; create a new job that supersedes this one

---

## STEP 7 — PR closure flow

Triggered when the user says "PR merged", gives a PR number, or says "I closed PR #N".

1. Run `git log --merges --oneline -5` to identify what shipped
2. Cross-reference with `jobs/done/` to find the corresponding job by matching the
   branch name in its `## Result` section
3. Run full roadmap and docs sync:
   - Verify ROADMAP.md items are correctly marked `[x]`
   - Check if REFERENCE.md needs updating (new endpoints, schema changes, new tools)
   - Run version string consistency check across ROADMAP.md and REFERENCE.md
4. If all items in a version section are now `[x]`:
   - Update the version header to include `✓` (`### V1.1 — Hardening · ✓`)
   - Update the "Current version" string at the top of ROADMAP.md
5. Report: what was synced, any doc gaps found, next unblocked job
